# Meta Box Basics

This plugin is a companion to the [Meta Box Basics Lab](https://knowthecode.io/labs/meta-box-basics) on [Know the Code](https://knowthecode.io).  It provides a boilerplate you can use for every meta box you create.

## Installation

1. In terminal, navigate to `{path to your sandbox project}/wp-content/plugins`.
2. Then type in terminal: `git clone https://github.com/KnowTheCode/meta-box-basics.git`.
3. Then type in terminal: `cd meta-box-basics`
4. Make sure you are on the `master` branch, which is your starting boilerplate.
    4.a. Type: `git branch`.  What branch does it say you are on?  If `master`, go to step 5. Else, go to 4.b.
    4.b. Type: `git checkout master`.
5. Log into your WordPress website.
6. Go to Plugins and activate the Meta Box Basics plugin.

Then go do the lab with me to build a meta box from scratch.  We'll use this boilerplate for multiple labs including building a repeater as you explore JavaScript too.
